Q: Select the correct ordering of steps for a preorder depth-first traversal.

A: 

Visit the node
Go to the left subtree
Go to the right subtree

This traversal type is very similar to an inorder traversal except that the three steps' order is slightly different. Notice that in this traversal, we "visit" the node (denoted in the visualization below by the node turning red) before we recurse to the left subtree (we represent the recursive call by turning the node grey in the visualization below). In the inorder traversal above, we recursed to the left subtree before visiting the node.
