### Questions

## - UNDERSTAND

Every problem, large or small, can be broken into smaller chunks. Logically, if you can take a seemingly unsolvable problem and break it into smaller, more manageable chunks, once you've finished solving each piece of the problem, you'll have conquered the whole thing!

What are the inputs your code receives?
What is the range of the input?
How big can the input be (how much data)?
What are the outputs your code produces?
What is the range of the output?
How big can the output be (how much data)?
How performant must the code be?
Is there anything missing from the task description that needs to be clarified?
What assumptions are you making?
Does anyone else on the team need to validate these assumptions?

## - ACTIONS

- ask questions
- Try to digest the problem and comprehend it by rewriting the problem in your own words. If you had to describe it to someone else, how would you do it?
- Diagram how the data flows through the problem. Think about each stage of the journey for the data. What will happen to it as it travels from one step to another?
- Think like a villain. What inputs would break your program.

- Where is the description of the problem incomplete? If you cannot get answers on something that the specifications leave unclear, make an educated guess, and document your assumptions and decision.

- You are done with this step when you can explain this problem to someone who has never seen it. Your explanation should be thorough enough for the person to skip the "Understand" step and start planning right away.

## - PLAN

- What steps will I take to solve the problem?
  You will take your description of the problem and transform it into a complete, actionable plan to solve that problem. If you realize you still don't truly understand the problem while planning, return to Understand until you resolve the ambiguity. If you have not yet completed Understand, you will end up planning to solve the wrong problem!
- When interviewing, you must do this step aloud!
- Remember, you aren’t coding during this step unless it’s a small piece of throwaway code to test a hypothesis.
- It would be best if you wrote pseudocode during this step, however.

## - ACTIONS

- Solve the problem like a human. If you’re sorting something, imagine your task as a pile of blocks that you need to sort by hand. Break down the steps you take into small enough pieces for a computer to understand. Approach the problem from many angles.

- Get a brute-force solution as quickly as possible. Even if it’s not performant enough, it can lead you toward better solutions.

-Come up with as many plans of attack as you can. Choose the best one that satisfies performance needs.

- Try to solve a simpler version of the problem. If the input is a 2D array, can you solve it for a 1D array? If you need to count the number of ways to eat cookies 1, 2, or 3 at a time, first try to solve it for the number of ways you could eat two at a time, or even one at a time. The solution to the more straightforward problem can lead to insights on the more complex problem.

- List the nouns and verbs in the problem description. Map each one to an algorithm, process, data structure, object, method, function, etc.

- "Perfect" can be the enemy of "good." Even if your initial workable solution isn’t performant enough, you can iterate later. “Premature optimization is the root of all evil.”

- You know that you completed this step when you have pseudocode that’s detailed enough to convert to real code. It would be best if you also were convinced the pseudocode represents a legitimate working solution.

## - EXECUTE

- This step is where you take your plan and convert it to actual working code. This step isn’t easy, but it’s much easier if you've done an excellent job with the "Understand" and "Plan" steps above. If you find shortcomings in your plan while implementing the solution, return to the "Plan" phase until you resolve the ambiguity. If you have not yet completed the "Plan" step, you will spend far longer on the "Execute" step than you have to.

# Questions

Think like a villain. Does your implementation handle all inputs?

What is the best way to split this code into separate functions or classes?

Does this functionality already exist?

Are there built-in libraries I can leverage?

Are there third-party libraries I can leverage?

# Actions

- Convert your pseudocode and outlines into actual code. Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY): Remove redundant code as you write it.

- Document code as you write it. Header blocks should contain information on how someone should use the code. Comment only when necessary; where possible, write code clearly enough that comments aren’t needed. If comments help clarify or summarize a piece of code to a reader, definitely add comments.

- If you write code that’s hackish or kludgy, fix it. If you don’t have time to fix it, comment it, explain why you couldn’t do it "the right way" (time constraints, etc.), and what you need to do to make it right.

- You know this step is complete when your solution works on good data, it doesn't fail on flawed data or edge cases, and the program passes all of the tests.

## Reflect

The primary question you are dealing with during this step is — "is this implementation as good as I can make it?" Would I be proud to show my code to another programmer?

# Questions

Does your solution work in all cases?
Main case?

Edge cases?

Is the solution performant enough?

Is the code documented?

In retrospect, what would you do differently? What will you do differently next time?

What went right?

What went wrong?

## Actions

Adding documentation is a necessary action during this step. It would be best if you documented any future changes you plan on making. You should document any code sections that you will need to make more performant if the data size increases.

Another critical action to take during this step is to remove any redundant or unnecessary code. Also, depending on your time constraints, it's likely that you might have some hackish code that you'd like to improve in the future when time allows. Make sure to document any ideas or plans on how you might do so.

You know that this step is complete when your code is adequately refactored and exhaustively documented.
